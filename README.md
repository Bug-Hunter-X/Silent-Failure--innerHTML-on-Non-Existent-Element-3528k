# Silent Failure: innerHTML on a Non-Existent Element

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug involving the use of `innerHTML` on an element that doesn't exist in the DOM yet.  The code attempts to modify the `innerHTML` of an element that hasn't been fully parsed by the browser, resulting in a silent failureâ€”no error is thrown, and the intended changes don't occur.

This type of bug can be challenging to debug because it doesn't produce any obvious error messages. The solution emphasizes ensuring that elements are accessed only after they are fully loaded and available in the DOM.
